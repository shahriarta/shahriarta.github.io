The word <em>algorithm</em> traces back to the 9th-century Persian mathematician <strong>Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwarizmi</strong>, whose influential works on arithmetic and algebra shaped early mathematics from Central Asia to Europe. When his writings were translated into Latin during the Middle Ages, his name became <em>Algorithmi</em>—a transformation that eventually gave rise to the modern term.  
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Al-Khwarizmi’s contributions did more than introduce new mathematical techniques: they established a structured, repeatable, and logical approach to problem-solving. This spirit of step-by-step reasoning is precisely what we now call an <strong>algorithm</strong>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Below is a concise, “PowerPoint-style” overview of how the concept of algorithms evolved—from Al-Khwarizmi’s arithmetic procedures to the computational engines of today. Feel free to build on these points or explore them further:

<h2 id="a-brief-historical-arc-of-algorithms">A Brief Historical Arc of Algorithms</h2>

<h3 id="1-the-foundations--al-khwarizmi-9th-century"><strong>1. The Foundations — Al-Khwarizmi (9th century)</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Authored <em>Kitāb al-Jabr wa-l-Muqābala</em>, which systematized algebra.</li>
  <li>Introduced procedural arithmetic methods, especially for Hindu–Arabic numerals.</li>
  <li>His structured problem-solving techniques became early algorithmic templates.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-medieval-transmission-12th15th-centuries"><strong>2. Medieval Transmission (12th–15th centuries)</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Translations into Latin spread his methods across Europe.</li>
  <li>The term <em>algorismus</em> referred to rules for computation with the new numeral system.</li>
  <li>Algorithms began to be seen as formal procedures rather than ad-hoc methods.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-early-mechanical-computation-17th19th-centuries"><strong>3. Early Mechanical Computation (17th–19th centuries)</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Thinkers like Pascal, Leibniz, and Babbage designed mechanical calculators.</li>
  <li>These machines executed fixed, well-defined sequences—physical algorithms.</li>
  <li>Abstraction grew: procedures could be separated from the machine itself.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-mathematical-formalization-20th-century"><strong>4. Mathematical Formalization (20th century)</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hilbert’s Entscheidungsproblem prompted the search for a rigorous definition.</li>
  <li>Church, Turing, and Gödel formalized algorithmic computability.</li>
  <li>Turing machines became the standard model for “effective procedures.”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5-the-digital-age-1950s2000s"><strong>5. The Digital Age (1950s–2000s)</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Algorithms expanded into sorting, searching, optimization, cryptography, and more.</li>
  <li>Programming languages allowed humans to express algorithms precisely.</li>
  <li>Complexity theory emerged to measure efficiency (e.g., O(n log n)).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6-the-algorithmic-world-2000s"><strong>6. The Algorithmic World (2000s–)</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Algorithms now power search engines, recommendation systems, mobile apps, robotics, and finance.</li>
  <li>Machine learning introduced data-driven algorithms that <em>learn</em> patterns rather than being fully hand-designed.</li>
  <li>Ethical and societal questions—fairness, transparency, privacy—became central.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="7-the-generative-ai-era-2014"><strong>7. The Generative AI Era (2014–)</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Generative models and Transformers enabled models that learn patterns from massive data instead of fixed rules.</li>
  <li>Generative AI creates text, images, code, and more.</li>
  <li>Foundation models handle many tasks with a single architecture.</li>
  <li>Focus shifts from writing algorithms to shaping data, training, and alignment.</li>
  <li>This era brings new challenges in trust, <strong>safety</strong>, and interpretability.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-al-khwarizmi-still-matters">Why Al-Khwarizmi Still Matters</h2>
<p>Even though modern algorithms run on unimaginable scales across billions of devices, the core idea remains faithful to Al-Khwarizmi’s legacy:<br />
<strong>a finite, logical sequence of steps that transforms input into meaningful output.</strong></p>

<p>His name survives not just in terminology but in the intellectual DNA of computer science itself.</p>
