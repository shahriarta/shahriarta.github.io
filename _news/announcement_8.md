📝 Our new work on learning optimal filtering is now available on <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17836'>arXiv</a>:
<br>
&emsp;&ensp; Title: <em>Data-driven Optimal Filtering for Linear Systems with Unknown Noise Covariances</em>
<br>
&emsp;&ensp; 🗣  I've presented its application to estimation for aeroelastic modal displacement of flexible wings at <a href='https://acc2023.a2c2.org'>ACC 2023</a>
