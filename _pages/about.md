I am an Assistant Professor with the Samueli School of Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles <a href='https://www.ucla.edu/'>(UCLA)</a>, affiliated with the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering <a href='https://mae.ucla.edu/'>(MAE)</a>, as of July 2025.

Prior to joining UCLA, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow affiliated with Harvard, the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences <a href='https://seas.harvard.edu/'>(Harvard SEAS)</a>, working with Professor <a href='https://nali.seas.harvard.edu'>Na (Lina) Li</a>, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences <a href='https://www.fas.harvard.edu/'>(Harvard FAS)</a>, working with Professor <a href='https://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu'>Lucas Janson</a>. I was also involved with the NSF AI Institute in Dynamic Systems <a href='https://dynamicsai.org'>(Dynamics AI)</a>.

I received my Ph.D. in control theory in 2023 under 
the supervision of Professor <a href="https://mehran-mesbahi.github.io">Mehran Mesbahi</a>
 at the University of Washington, Seattle, where my 
research focused on constrained decision-making and control in complex systems.
 <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/uwthesis.pdf" target="_blank">My dissertation</a>, titled "Constrained Policy Synthesis:
 Riemannian Flows, Online Regulation, and Distributed Games," 
explored novel methods for policy optimization under constraints. 
Simultaneously, I earned 
my M.Sc. in Mathematics, specializing in differential geometry, under the supervison of Professor
 <a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu//~lee/">John M. Lee</a>, also at the University of Washington. 
This unique combination of control theory 
and differential geometry has equipped me with a robust mathematical foundation for 
addressing challenges in scalable control and decision-making frameworks from a distinctive angle. 
Recently, I had the honor of being interviewed by Rodolphe Sepulchre in <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10317610'>IEEE Control Systems Magazine</a>.

My research focuses on developing rigorous mathematical frameworks that leverage geometry, machine learning, and control to study data-driven decision-making and data science. I address challenges in learning and decision-making in complex systems, with a focus on geometric methods for inference and decision-making under uncertainty. I have published over 20 papers and reviewed more than 40 papers (see my <a href='https://www.webofscience.com/wos-researcher-cv/public/3551560/a7c90fc9-e576-4955-a6bf-d7df972d61c7/ShahriarTalebi_Web_of_Science_Researcher_CV.pdf'>Web of Science profile summary</a>). I am a recipient of the Excellence in Teaching Award at the University of Washington and have been recognized with several scholarships and fellowships throughout my academic career.

	<summary>...more about me.</summary>
	I received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Sharif 
University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2014, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering 
from the University of Central Florida (UCF), Orlando, FL, USA, in 2017, both in the area of 
control theory. I'm honored by the 2022 Excellence in Teaching Award at the University of Washington.
I'm also a recipient of William E. Boeing Endowed Fellowship, Paul A. 
Carlstedt Endowment, and Latvian Arctic Pilot–A. Vagners Memorial Scholarship with UW 
in 2018 and 2019, and Frank Hubbard Engineering Scholarship with UCF in 2017.
