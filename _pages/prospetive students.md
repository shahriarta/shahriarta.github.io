<p>I am actively looking for highly motivated individuals at all levels—including <strong>Ph.D. students, master’s students, undergraduates, and postdoctoral researchers</strong>—to join my research group at the <strong>University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE)</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in joining the lab, please <strong>email me directly</strong> at <span class="email-address">s[dot]talebi[at]ucla.edu</span> with the subject line: <strong>"Prospective Student/Postdoc Inquiry: [Your Name]"</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>what to include in your email</h2>

<p>To ensure I can properly assess the potential fit, your initial email should include the following attachments and information:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>A concise cover letter</strong> (in the email body or as a PDF attachment) that clearly states:
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>position</strong> you are applying for (Ph.D., M.S., Undergraduate Researcher, Postdoc).</li>
            <li>Your specific <strong>research interests</strong> and how they align with my group's focus on <strong>Geometric Learning and Control, Data-Driven Decision-Making, and Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning</strong>.</li>
            <li>Your <strong>availability</strong> (e.g., intending to apply for Fall 2026 admission, seeking a summer 2026 internship, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Your <strong>Curriculum Vitae (CV) or Resume</strong> (PDF format).</li>
    <li>Your <strong>Academic Transcripts</strong> (unofficial copies are fine for initial inquiry).</li>
    <li>If applicable, a sample of your <strong>published or unpublished research work</strong> (e.g., a paper or thesis).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Due to the volume of inquiries, I may not be able to respond to every email individually. I will follow up if there is an opportunity that aligns closely with your background and interests.</em></p>

<h2>prospective Ph.D. students</h2>

<p>I am currently recruiting motivated Ph.D. students interested in <strong>Geometric Learning and Control, Data-Driven Decision-Making, and Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning</strong>. I anticipate recruiting students primarily during the regular application cycle in <strong>December 2025 for Fall 2026</strong> admission.</p>

<p>Applicants should possess a strong mathematical background and hold a B.S. or M.S. degree in a related field, including (but not limited to) <strong>Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, or Systems Engineering</strong>.</p>

<p>Competitive applicants often have:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Robust mathematical foundations</strong> in analysis, control and estimation theory, differential geometry, stochastic processes, optimization, or machine learning.</li>
    <li><strong>Strong programming skills</strong> and experience with machine learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, JAX).</li>
    <li>Prior research experience in topics like data-driven control and estimation, reinforcement learning, policy optimization, Riemannian optimization, and related areas.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>master’s and undergraduate students</h2>

<p>If you are currently affiliated with UCLA (or will be starting soon) and are interested in research, please <strong>email me directly</strong> as detailed above. We can discuss opportunities for independent study, capstone projects, or research assistant positions within the <strong>MAE Department</strong>. Non-UCLA students interested in a <strong>summer research internship</strong> should also reach out via email by <strong>March 1st</strong> of the year they wish to intern.</p>

<hr>

<h2>postdoctoral scholars</h2>

<p>If you are seeking a Postdoctoral appointment, please <strong>email me directly</strong> including all the required attachments listed above, and specifically include a <strong>1-2 page research statement</strong> summarizing your past research, current expertise, and future research directions you propose to pursue that align with the group's focus on geometry-informed learning and control.</p>
